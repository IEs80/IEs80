## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm, an Electronics Engeneerning student at UTN, Buenos Aires, Argentina; I have experience in low and high level programming. I've have always been passionate about coding and solving real life problems through it!

I'm interested by the potential of Web3 and decentralized technologies and would like to explore, and build projects that emphasize security, confidentiality and efficiency
